Hey, I'm Kormi and I'll be putting some codes I wrote here.

I work with Biopython and proteins, so most of the codes will likely be related to that.

I will also be uploading my Advent of Code codes (https://adventofcode.com/). They will probably be disgusting but you can check!

If you stumble upon these or look for them for whatever reason and need any help, lemme know. :)
